Can Artificial Intelligence (AI) prevent the next epidemic, especially the more-deadly Disease X? Can AI-driven contact tracing strategies learn from past superspreading outbreaks to control future epidemics? To advance health informatics is one of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenges. In [1-4], we examine how network science, big data analytics and machine learning can address large-scale problems such as digital contact tracing and Infodemic management using COVID-19 data.</description></item><item><title>Short Introduction</title><link>http://example.org/homepage/short-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2022 14:31:37 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/homepage/short-introduction/</guid><description>Research interests are optimization of networks, distributed machine learning, cloud computing and AI.</description></item><item><title>Software and Openings</title><link>http://example.org/software-and-openings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2022 14:31:37 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/software-and-openings/</guid><description>Ph.D. student openings: (1) Distributed machine learning and optimization

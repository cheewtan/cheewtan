                      <h5> Group testing – A tool of protecting network security </h5>
                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> In recent years, group testing has become one of the most effective search methods in various topics such as DNA sequencing, compressed sensing, drug testing and also network security. In this talk, we shall focus on its role on network security. The main subjects we are concerned are (1) Denial-of-Service attack of internet, (2) Jammer detection in wireless sensor network and (3) Multimedia fingerprinting collusion-attack. We start with an introduction of group testing with various models and algorithms. Then we apply suitable models to protect the security of network under the above mentioned attacks.

                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                      In this talk, we explore fundamental information theoretic limits of ‘’deniable’’ communication. We consider the following scenario: Alice (e.g. a whistleblower) wants to communicate deniably to Bob (say, a reporter) knowing that even a suspicion of communication by Willie  (e.g., an oppressive organisation) could have dire consequences. Under this communication setting, we require two things - (a) the message be reliably decoded by Bob, (b) the communication be deniable to Willie, i.e., the statistics of the codewords don’t look too different from that of innocent communication. 

Partly motivated by the recent debate around privacy, this theme has been receiving an increasing amount of attention in the information theoretic community and has also been referred through the nomenclatures “low probability of detection communication” and “stealth”. In the first half of the talk, we survey some recent results in this area. Specifically, we focus on the broadcast channel version of this problem where Bob has a “cleaner” channel than Willie. In the second half of the talk, we focus on our recent work on leveraging channel uncertainty to enable deniable communication. We consider a Binary Symmetric Channel to both Bob and Willie where the channel distributions are not fully known to any party. We show that when the uncertainty on Willie’s channel is “larger” than Bob’s channel, positive rate is possible. The work presented here is based on joint work with Pak Hou Che and Sidharth Jaggi.

                      <h5>Opportunistic Detection Rules  </h5>
                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> Opportunistic detection rules (ODRs) are variants of fixed-sample-size detection rules in which the statistician is allowed to make an early decision on the alternative hypothesis opportunistically based on the sequentially observed samples. From a sequential decision perspective, ODRs are also mixtures of one-sided and truncated sequential detection rules. Several key properties of ODRs are introduced, in both the finite regime in which the maximum sample size is a fixed finite number, and the asymptotic regime in which the maximum sample size grows without bound.

                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk, we present a multihypothesis social learning framework in which an agent has access to a set of private observations, and chooses an opinion from another set of agents to incorporate into its final decision. Our goal is to determine how the first agent can optimally choose which other agent's opinion to listen to. To model individual biases, we allow the agents to have general loss functions and possibly different decision spaces. We show the impact of incorporating another agent's opinion on the loss exponent of the first agent, and arrive at the somewhat surprising conclusion that it may not be optimal for the first agent to listen to another agent with the same loss function as itself. We also show when there is no loss in optimality in ignoring another agent with a smaller decision space.

                      <h5> Source Coding with Side Information for EPS Systems </h5>
                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> Source coding problems with the requirements of perfect secrecy and zero error at receivers is considered in this talk. We assume that there is always one transmitter but there can be one or two receivers. Two different scenarios depending on whether the receivers’ side information are present at the transmitter or not are considered. By deriving bounds on the probability masses of the cipher-text and the key, the minimum transmission rate and key rate are characterized. Although zero-error capacities are typically difficult to characterize, the perfect secrecy constraint turns out to be the key that simplifies the problems considered in this talk and makes them analytically tractable.

                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk, we derive the capacity regions of a continuous-time white Gaussian multiple access channel with/without feedback, a continuous-time white Gaussian interference channel without feedback and a continuous-time white Gaussian broadcast channel without feedback. 
These "complete" results stand in stark contrast to the status quo of network information theory in discrete-time, where the capacity regions of the all the above-mentioned channels are known only for a handful of special scenarios.

                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> Sys-admin Alice wants to save files in a distributed network for Bob to access. Some nodes might be eavesdropped on by evil Eve, and the information some (possibly overlapping set) may be completely corrupted by her. To reiterate, some nodes may be entirely untouched by Eve, some may only be eavesdropped on but not corrupted, some may only be corrupted without being eavesdropped on (for instance, when the information on that node is encrypted, and Eve can glean no useful information on it, but still has the ability to overwrite whatever was on that node), and finally some may be both eavesdropped on and corrupted. We examine the interplay between Eve's eavesdropping and jamming abilities, and give a complete information-theoretic characterization of the capacity of the problem.

                      <h5> BackLog Based Random Access in Wireless Networks : (In)Stability Issues and Fluid Limits </h5>
                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> This talk addresses the problem of stabilising CSMA/CD networks using
                      queue based backoff algorithms. It has been shown that if the backoff
                      dependence on queue length is logarithmic (as we subsequently define)
                      then throughput stability is achieved for such algorithms on arbitrary interference graphs.                      

                      Unfortunately recent research has shown that this leads to exponential growth
                      in delay as a function of utilisation as opposed to the growth in delay
                      for an ordinary M/M/1 queue. This makes operation of such networks using
                      these algorithms quite impractical.

                      There is left the possibility that stability might be upheld by using
                      functions of queue length which are more aggressive than the logarithmic
                      dependence mentioned above. However as we show for a small network the
                      property of throughput optimality is lost. This is demonstrated using
                      an instability property due to Meyn applied to fluid limits of the
                      underlying process.

                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> Conventional storage systems are designed to tolerate disk failures. Source data are encoded and distributed to an array of disks, so that a number of disk failures can be tolerated. Even though a small fraction of the disk is in error, the whole disk is considered erased. However, partial disk error, such as sector error, is not uncommon. For example, in solid-state drive, a block of memory will become unusable after many overwriting operations. A sector error may be latent for a period of time. We need to probe the memory periodically to see whether it is functioning properly. In large-scale storage systems, this probing process can a long time and a sector error may not be discovered immediately. If a disk in a storage system fails, a latent sector error in another disk may result in permanent data loss. In order to recover a mixture of entire disk failures and partial disk failures, Plank et al. proposed a new class of array codes, called sector-disk code. The construction by Plank et al. is based on the design of the parity-check matrix. In this talk, we give another construction via the generator matrix.

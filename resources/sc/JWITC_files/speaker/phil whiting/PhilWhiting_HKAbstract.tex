Talk Abstract

This talk addresses the problem of stabilising CSMA/CD networks using
queue based backoff algorithms. It has been shown that if the backoff
dependence on queue length is logarithmic (as we subsequently define)
then throughput stability is achieved for such algorithms on arbitrary interference graphs.

Unfortunately recent research has shown that this leads to exponential growth
in delay as a function of utilisation as opposed to the growth in delay
for an ordinary M/M/1 queue. This makes operation of such networks using
these algorithms quite impractical.

There is left the possibility that stability might be upheld by using
functions of queue length which are more aggressive than the logarithmic
dependence mentioned above. However as we show for a small network the
property of throughput optimality is lost. This is demonstrated using
an instability property due to Meyn applied to fluid limits of the
underlying process.
